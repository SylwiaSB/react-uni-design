<b>Website Design for a 3D Scanning, Digitization, and Design Company

Our proposed project is to design a new website for a company specializing in 3D scanning, digitization, and design services. The website will be a platform for the company to showcase their expertise and services to potential customers, as well as to provide information on their capabilities and experience in the industry.

The website will have a modern and visually appealing design that highlights the company's brand and services. It will be optimized for user experience, with clear navigation and easy-to-use features that allow visitors to quickly find the information they need. The website will also be fully responsive, ensuring that it is accessible and easy to use on any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Setup
Here's a short guide on how to run a program from a GitHub repository that uses the React library:

* Make sure you have the tools required to run the program, such as Node.js and npm, installed on your computer.
Go to the repository on GitHub and clone the source code to your local computer using the "git clone" command (e.g. git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git).
* Navigate to the directory containing the program's source code.
* Run the npm install command to download and install the program's required dependencies.
* Compile the source code by running the npm run build command.
* Run the program by opening the index.html file in a web browser or by running a local server that serves the contents of the build directory.
* Remember that configuration and running details may differ depending on the program's specifications, so be sure to carefully read the documentation and instructions.
